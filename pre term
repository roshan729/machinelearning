In my one year program at Great Lakes, I would contribute to the overall experience of the batch in many ways. I have been working in the IT industry for over 5 years and I could share my experience and knowledge to everyone which they may find it useful and have a better understanding of things. 
I have worked as a technical consultant in an enterprise resource planning application for more than 5 years. My role was to provide technical solutions to help meet business requirements.  I have worked in various modules of ERP from supply chain as well as finance. So I have a broad understanding of different modules function and how they are linked to one another. I can share this knowledge with the whole class to help them understand how businesses works and what goes on in each aspect of it.
Apart from working as a consultant, I have also worked as an analyst and architect. I have helped certain business applications to improve their performance by analyzing the application and reworking the design. I can help other classmates to look at problem statements and analyze how its working and what can be done to make it better. This way, they can develop a work ethic that will generate efficient solutions to improve businesses.
Other than working in ERP, I have also worked in analytics. I have learnt machine learning and worked on many models related to supervised learning. Machine learning is an interesting and very vast field which combines programming, mathematics and statistics to develop models that can give more accurate insight from data. As I have prior experience of starting from scratch, I can guide others who are starting out in a proper way so that they donâ€™t get lost .
I can contribute to the entire class in these many ways but I am sure that others can contribute more to my learning experience. I will get to interact with people from various fields and their perspective will help me get a better understanding of things.
